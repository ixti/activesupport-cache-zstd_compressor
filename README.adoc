= ActiveSupport::Cache::ZstdCompressor

A blazing-fast https://facebook.github.io/zstd/[Zstandard] compressor for
`ActiveSupport::Cache`. Built for developers who appreciate both performance
and the finer things in life, like not waiting forever for cache operations.

üöÄ Blazing Speed:: Decompression speeds that make LZ4 look sleepy.
üéØ Excellent Ratios:: Better compression than gzip with less CPU drama.
‚ö° Tunable Performance:: 30 compression levels from "ludicrous speed" to "maximum squeeze".
üß† Smart Memory Usage:: Uses modern amounts of RAM because it's not 1995 anymore.


== Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

[source,bash]
----
bundle add activesupport-cache-zstd_compressor
----

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

[source,bash]
----
gem install activesupport-cache-zstd_compressor
----


== Usage

[source,ruby]
----
Rails.application.configure do
  config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {
  url:        ENV["REDIS_URL"],
  compress:   true,
  compressor: ActiveSupport::Cache::ZstdCompressor.new
}
----

By default, it uses compression level `3`, but you can easily tweak it:

[source,ruby]
----
Rails.application.configure do
  config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {
  url:        ENV["REDIS_URL"],
  compress:   true,
  compressor: ActiveSupport::Cache::ZstdCompressor.new(level: 6)
}
----


=== Migrating from Rails default compressor (Zlib)

TIP: Perfect for production environments where cache invalidation is not an option.

[source,ruby]
----
Rails.application.configure do
  config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {
  url:        ENV["REDIS_URL"],
  compress:   true,
  compressor: ActiveSupport::Cache::ZstdCompressor::WithZlibFallback.new
}
----

How it works::
. üîç Detects compressed data format by magic number
. üìñ Reads existing Zlib-compressed cache entries seamlessly
. ‚úçÔ∏è Writes all new entries using superior Zstd compression


== Compatibility

This library aims to support and is tested against:

* https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby]

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby versions,
however support will only be provided for the versions listed above.


== Development
